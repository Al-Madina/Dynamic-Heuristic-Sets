/**
 * This package contains all classes that implements different aspects of the
 * dynamic sets.
 * <p>
 * This includes the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Performance measures that evaluate the performance of low-level heuristics.
 * <li> Removal strategies that decide when and which heuristics to remove permanently.
 * <li> Reset conditions to decide when to reset the <i>active set</i> to include 
 * all heuristics.
 * <li> Update strategies that determine when and how to update the active set.
 * </ul>
